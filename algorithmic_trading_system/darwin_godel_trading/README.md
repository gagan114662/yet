# Darwin Gödel Trading Machine (DGTM)

## Overview

An implementation of the Darwin Gödel Machine architecture for self-improving algorithmic trading systems. The DGTM autonomously evolves trading strategies to exceed target performance metrics.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Archive**: Population of trading strategies
2. **Self-Modification Engine**: Modifies strategy code
3. **Evaluation Framework**: Backtests on real market data
4. **Open-Ended Explorer**: Selects parents for evolution

### Key Features

- Self-referential improvement: Strategies modify their own code
- Population-based exploration: Maintains diverse solutions
- Empirical validation: Uses backtesting for fitness
- Open-ended evolution: Avoids local optima

## Target Metrics

- Primary: CAGR > 25%
- Secondary: Sharpe Ratio > 1.0
- Constraints: Max Drawdown < 20%

## Implementation Plan

1. Initialize with base trading agents
2. Self-modification loop:
   - Select parent agents based on performance
   - Analyze backtest logs
   - Propose improvements
   - Implement modifications
   - Validate through backtesting
3. Archive successful mutations
4. Continue evolution until targets achieved
